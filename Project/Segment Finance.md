### Segment Finance: Understanding the Concept

Segment Finance is a decentralized and non-custodial liquidity market on the BNB-chain, audited by Verichains[^1]. It operates as a component of a business that generates its own revenues and products, known as a business segment[^2]. In the context of financial transparency, segment reporting is crucial for large corporations to provide insights into the financial performance and risks associated with different segments of a company[^3].
