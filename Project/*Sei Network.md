# Sei protocol : What we need to know 

The SEI Network is a blockchain layer 1 that is part of the Cosmos ecosystem and is designed to serve as an advanced infrastructure for decentralized finance (DeFi) applications, particularly those that use a natively integrated central limit order book (CLOB) for their operations. It is expected to be highly scalable, application-specific, and bring significant benefits to both developers and DeFi users. Some key features of the SEI Network include:

1. **Order-Book Oriented**: SEI Network is the first blockchain that is order-book oriented, allowing for more efficient and customizable dApps.
2. **Interoperability**: As a Cosmos chain, SEI can connect to more than 50 other inter-operational Tier 1s that use IBC.
3. **Built-in Features**: SEI Network has built-in features such as a publicly accessible order book, price oracle, and front-running protection.
4. **Scalability**: SEI Network is expected to be highly scalable, with a lower bound of 300ms and an upper bound of 20,000 operations per second (OPS).
5. **Security**: SEI Network uses Twin Turbo Consensus, which provides decentralized trading apps with speed, security, capital efficiency, and decentralization.
6. **MEV Prevention**: SEI Network has a MEV prevention mechanism that prevents malicious front-running, a common issue in other ecosystems.
7. **Flexible Parallelization**: SEI uses market-based parallelization to increase throughput by 5-10 times greater than most other high-performance blockchains.

The SEI Network is still under development and is expected to bring significant improvements to the DeFi ecosystem by offering a more efficient and customizable platform for decentralized applications.
