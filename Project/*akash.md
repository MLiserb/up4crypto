**Akash: What You Need to Know**

Akash is an open network facilitating the buying and selling of cloud resources using its native token, $AKT. It operates as a layer-1 blockchain within the Cosmos SDK, offering decentralized cloud computing services for CPU/GPU power and dedicated IP renting. The $AKT token is crucial for governance and incentivizing cloud providers, with a fixed supply of around 389 million tokens. Akash aims to be the first 'Supercloud,' providing permissionless access to cloud resources[^1][^2].

The network has expanded to include GPU services, attracting interest from AI and machine learning companies. Akash incentivizes GPU providers with rewards and aims to offer high-density GPUs like the A100 at competitive rates. Governance plays a significant role in Akash, with over 280 proposals made for network improvements, emphasizing transparency and community involvement[^2].

Akash operates a GPU marketplace where users can buy and sell decentralized cloud computing resources. It leverages Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS) for consensus, allowing users to stake $AKT tokens and receive rewards. The platform offers cost-effective hosting compared to major cloud providers like AWS, Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure. Akash's decentralized approach enables users to run any cloud-native application without vendor lock-in[^3].

In summary, Akash Network provides a decentralized platform for cloud resource trading, offering cost-effective solutions through its GPU marketplace and innovative governance structure that prioritizes community involvement and transparency[^3].
