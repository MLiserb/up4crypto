# Lava Network: What You Need to Know

**Lava Network: Key Information**

Lava Network is a modular data network designed to enhance developers' flexibility and empower them to build across various platforms. Here are some essential points to understand about Lava Network:

- **Founders and Origins**: Co-Founded by Yair Cleper and Gil Binder, Lava Network originated from the idea of creating a multi-chain NFT marketplace. Facing challenges with node providers for different blockchains, they shifted their focus to Ethereum initially[^1].

- **Functionality**: Lava Network acts as a dynamic P2P marketplace connecting blockchains and dApps with node providers offering RPC services and data. It provides a platform for direct communication between dApps and multiple providers without intermediaries, rewarding providers based on reviews[^1].

- **Modular Data Access**: Lava Network is a modular data network that allows developers scalable access to any rollup or blockchain. It offers a peer-to-peer SDK for direct communication, enabling quick addition of new chains and APIs based on demand[^2].

- **Champions and Providers**: In the Lava ecosystem, 'Champions' define RPC API for specific chains, offering these specs to the community. Node providers can then spin up nodes based on these specs, ensuring scalability and reliability through multiple providers[^2].

- **Accessibility and Scalability**: Lava Network aims to be a one-stop platform for accessing blockchain data, eliminating the need for developers to individually obtain RPC providers. It provides quick access to data and RPCs, enhancing accessibility for various blockchains[^2].

In summary, Lava Network serves as a crucial infrastructure in the blockchain space, offering a dynamic marketplace for developers to access data and RPC services efficiently while promoting decentralization and scalability in the ecosystem.
