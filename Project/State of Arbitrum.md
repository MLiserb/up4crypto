# State of Arbitrum: What You Need to Know

**State of Arbitrum: Key Information**

Arbitrum is a suite of Ethereum Layer-2 scaling solutions designed to enhance the Ethereum network's scalability and reduce transaction costs. Here are some essential points about Arbitrum's current state:

- **Dominance and Market Share**: Arbitrum remains the most dominant and widely adopted L2 on Ethereum, with approximately half of the market share and over 500 dApps built on it[4].

- **Technology and Security**: Arbitrum is based on Optimistic Rollups, which inherit Ethereum-level security. It uses a "trust-but-verify" approach, where transactions are initially assumed to be valid, but if a violation occurs, it can be disputed back on L1, and the invalid claim is disregarded[3].

- **Decentralization**: Arbitrum One's validator set is currently allowlisted, with governance expected to expand the allowlist and eventually remove it entirely. The validators are currently a committee of public entities, and governance has the power to change this status[2].

- **Transaction Confirmation**: There are two levels of finality in a transaction lifecycle: soft finality, where a transaction is confirmed once the Sequencer receives and processes it, and hard finality, where a transaction is considered final if there's at least one well-behaved active Arbitrum validator[2].

- **Dispute Window**: Arbitrum One's dispute window is set to one week, allowing validators enough time to dispute an invalid assertion[2].

- **Fiat On-ramps**: There are Fiat on-ramps that support Arbitrum, allowing users to deposit and withdraw fiat currency[2].

- **Transaction Fees**: Arbitrum transactions are cheaper and faster than on Ethereum, with batching and compressed data transmission contributing to lower transaction costs[3].

In summary, Arbitrum is a leading L2 solution for Ethereum, offering scalability, lower transaction costs, and a high level of security through Optimistic Rollups. It is actively working towards progressive decentralization and continues to absorb new technology trends to enhance its platform.
