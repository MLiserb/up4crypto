5. **The SEC of the United States began an investigation after converting from Taifang to POS and took legal action to define it as securities** 

The investigation by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) into the Ethereum Foundation, based in Switzerland, began shortly after Ethereum shifted to a new governance model based on Proof of Stake (POS) in September 2022. The Ethereum Foundation has received subpoenas in the past few weeks, and the SEC is actively pursuing legal action to classify Ethereum as a security.

On March 21st, Vitalik hosted a press conference in Taipei and declined to answer questions about the recent SEC investigation. When asked about the SEC investigation, Vitalik refused to answer the question and gave the reporter a "long stare." It was noted that the questions at the press conference were collected by an organizer from ETHTaipei, and follow-up questions or clarifications were not possible.

7. **The Bloomberg analyst predicts that this round of spot Ethereum ETF applications will be rejected on May 23rd.** 

James Seyffart, a Bloomberg analyst, stated that the likelihood of spot Ethereum ETF approval in May is decreasing. He anticipates that this round will ultimately be rejected on May 23 due to apparent lack of engagement between the U.S. regulatory authorities and potential issuers regarding these products. Previously, Seyffart and another Bloomberg analyst, Eric Balchunas, had given a 35% chance of approval for May. Currently, seven issuers are looking to launch Ethereum funds: BlackRock, Fidelity, Invesco with Galaxy, Grayscale, VanEck, 21 Shares, and Ark and Hashdex.

8. **The Nigerian High Court orders Binance to disclose all data of its Nigerian users.** 

The Nigerian authorities have increased their investigation efforts into Binance, as the Federal High Court has ordered Binance to provide detailed information of all Nigerian users to the country's foremost anti-corruption agency, the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC). It is unclear whether Binance will comply with the Nigerian authorities' request. Previously, FT reported that Binance's compliance officer, Tigran Gambaryan, and the regional manager for Africa, Nadeem Anjarwalla, were detained in Nigeria, and Nigeria demanded that Binance provide information on its top 100 users in the country and the full transaction history of the past six months.

Fox reporter Eleanor Terrett sought a comment from the US State Department regarding the arrest of Binance's financial crime compliance officer, Tigran Gambaryan, in Nigeria. The US State Department responded, "Our top priority is the safety and welfare of US citizens abroad. We are aware of reports of a US citizen being detained in Nigeria. When a US citizen is detained abroad, the Department will make every effort to provide appropriate assistance. Due to privacy considerations, we will not comment further."

10. **U.S. prosecutors urged the judge to sentence SBF to 40–50 years in prison** 

The US prosecutor requested the court to imprison the former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried for 40 to 50 years, and recommended a fine of more than $11 billion. The SBF will accept the verdict on March 28. The prosecutor emphasized in the memo that SBF's behavior showed unparalleled greed and arrogance, and he used other people's funds to conduct repeated gambling. In addition, the SBF did not stop the crime even after its arrest, so a severe sentence was required. SBF's lawyer previously requested a judgment period of 63 to 78 months.

Regarding the prosecutor’s view that it is necessary to sentence SBF to 40 to 50 years’ imprisonment, SBF’s lawyer stated that the prosecutor’s document was disturbing and claimed that the memo document distorted reality with obvious hostility and portrayed the SBF as a fallen super villain; Blame the dark and arrogant motives on the SBF，This is contrary to the record; and a medieval punishment view has been adopted, and a verdict equivalent to the death penalty in prison has been drawn.
