**2. **Emergent Trend: Is AI computing a threat to Bitcoin mining?**  
**CoinShares' latest report pointed out that after the Bitcoin halving, miners face a significant increase in costs, with electricity and overall costs almost doubling, and the average Bitcoin production cost is expected to be about $53,000. Mining companies may turn to the field of artificial intelligence and try to reduce costs by optimizing energy costs and mining efficiency, but the potential benefits of investing obsolete computing equipment in the field of AI may be higher. Mining companies such as BitDigital, Hive and Hut 8 have already earned revenue from the AI ​​field.

**3. US SEC expected to deny spot ether ETFs next month, industry sources say  
**U.S. issuers and other companies expect the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to reject their applications for Ethereum spot ETFs after meetings with the SEC in recent weeks, four people familiar with the matter said. The four people involved in the meeting said that recent meetings between issuers and the SEC were very one-sided, and agency staff did not discuss substantive details about the proposed products. This is in stark contrast to the intensive and detailed discussions in the weeks before the SEC approved the Bitcoin spot ETF in January.

**6. Consensys sues SEC after receiving Wells' notice**  
Consensys revealed in the lawsuit that it received a Wells Notice from the SEC on April 10, accusing MetaMask of operating as an unlicensed broker-dealer. Consensys' lawsuit against the SEC and all five of its commissioners states that the SEC should not be allowed to arbitrarily expand its jurisdiction and regulate the future of the Internet by falsely labeling ETH as a security. The company wants a federal court to declare that ETH is not a security and that any investigation of ConsenSys based on the view that ETH is a security "will violate" the company's Fifth Amendment rights and the Administrative Procedure Act.

**9. Morgan Stanley may explore allowing brokers to recommend Bitcoin ETFs

The company is currently laying the groundwork for tender purchases, including risk tolerance requirements and restrictions on allocation and trading frequency.

**10. **a16z crypto CTO Eddy Lazzarin slammed Memecoin**  
**a16z crypto CTO Eddy Lazzarin slammed Memecoin: Memecoin changed the views of the public, regulators and entrepreneurs on encrypted currency. At best, it looks like a risky casino. Or a series of false promises to cover up the casino. This deeply affects the behavior of the application, supervision/law and builder. If external factors are considered, it may even be net negative. I am here to build a new network and provide impetus for a fundamentally stronger Internet. In addition to undermining the long-term vision of encrypted currencies that left many of us in this area, Memecoin is not technically interesting.
